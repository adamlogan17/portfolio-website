# portfolio-website

This is a portfolio website of myself.

Within this website you can learn about myself, my work experience and about my education history. You can also download my CV and my completed projects.

## How do I get started?

You can visit the website [here](https://adam-logan-portfolio.netlify.app/) or you can clone this repository and open the ```index.html``` file

## TODOS

- Maybe move the assets folder into the public folder, read more [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/z6dsoh/can_someone_explain_to_me_what_the_public_folder/)
