                                    This week at PwC taught me how and the <i>importance of sticking to
                                    deadlines</i> and how to <i>manage my time effectively</i> to achieve 
                                    this goal. I also got an insight on the day-to-day operations of large

                                    built upon.

                                    When I was at the Generation Innovation work experience program, I
                                    was placed within a team, and then my team was assigned to
                                    LibertyIT. My team and I then had to pitch our solution to a problem
                                    given to us by LibertyIT, to several members of the company. After this
                                    we had to deliver the same pitch to the other teams on the program.
                                    This work experience program helped me to become a more <i>confident
                                    speaker</i>.

                                    through of my experiences. I was a Computing prefect and in this role I went to junior school 
                                    computing classes and assisted these students in their practical work. I also 
                                    created the rota for this programme, for the assistant prefects, alongside the senior 
                                    prefect. This helped me to develop my leadership and organisational skills.
