                                            During my time at tech central, I was on a project to develop an internal asset, which would insert data, from an 
                                            internal data source, directly into a google sheet. This asset took the form of a google workspace add on and was 
                                            developed using Apps Script. I spent most of my time on this project developing a way to dynamically make requests 
                                            to the internal API and manipulating the responses. One other key feature, which I also worked on, was the ability 
                                            to allow the user to preview the response and choose which fields they would like to import into their document.

                                            I demonstrated that I am able to work within a small team and within an <i>agile framework</i>. On this project 
                                            I gained experience and grew my technical knowledge within <i>Apps Script</i> and <i>REST APIs</i>. I also showed 
                                            that I am able to <i>work under time constraints</i>, as there were last minute changes requested.

                                            On this project I was assigned to a large team that was developing both a new ERP and an EPM 
                                            system for a client. I worked specifically within the EPM side of the project. My role within 
                                            this project was within PMO and test management of three new work streams in relation to planning 
                                            IFRS4. This allowed me to interact directly with the client by sending status reports and by 
                                            attending meetings with the client.

                                            Throughout my time on this project I developed my business acumen within this project and learned 
                                            new skills such as <i>Oracle Planning and management</i>. I developed an appreciation of the 
                                            importance of <i>testing</i> and gained knowledge within this field. I once again demonstrated my 
                                            ability to <i>work in a multicultural team</i> by working directly with colleagues from PwC India

                                            During this placement, I developed two prototype applications, one which monitors temperature
                                            and humidity sensors and another that acts as a ride management application, for a theme park. 
                                            These prototypes were developed using Vantiq which is an IoT processing platform. 
                                            The purpose of these prototypes, was to test if Vantiq is a viable platform for 
                                            PwC to use when developing smart venue and smart retail solutions.

                                            During the course of developing these prototypes I created several test harnesses which would 
                                            simulate data entering Azure. The first test harness that was created simulated temperature and 
                                            humidity sensors and the second test harness, which was developed, simulated people entering a queue
                                            for a ride. These test harnesses, are Web Apps that are deployed on Azure and were developed in 
                                            <i>Python</i> and used <i>Flask</i>, the <i>Azure SDK</i>, <i>HTML and CSS</i>.

                                            I not only developed and improved on the technical skills listed above, but I also demonstrated my ability to

                                    This week at PwC taught me how and the <i>importance of sticking to
                                    deadlines</i> and how to <i>manage my time effectively</i> to achieve 
                                    this goal. I also got an insight on the day-to-day operations of large
                                    organisations and the structure in which these organisations may be
                                    built upon.

                                    When I was at the Generation Innovation work experience program, I
                                    was placed within a team, and then my team was assigned to
                                    LibertyIT. My team and I then had to pitch our solution to a problem
                                    given to us by LibertyIT, to several members of the company. After this
                                    we had to deliver the same pitch to the other teams on the program.
                                    This work experience program helped me to become a more <i>confident
                                    speaker</i>.

                                    I spent three days at Ulster University, as part of the Sentinus Insight Into
                                    IT program, and this is where I conducted several experiments on virtual
                                    laboratories. This work experience program helped me to improve my
                                    <i>report writing skills</i> and <i>my research skills</i> through researching the
                                    different experiments which I carried out, such as an experiment on
                                    Brownian motion, and writing a report on these findings.

                                    At queen's I have learnt about many principles and concepts 
                                    within the of world software development. Throughout all the 
                                    modules one key area which was highlighted was security. This 
                                    was stressed within my databases, software design principles 
                                    and in my systems development modules. Another concept which 
                                    has been stressed throughout university is the importance of 
                                    documentation and the design phase. To this end within almost 
                                    every module I learnt about the nuances of the Unified 
                                    Modelling Language (UML).

                                    During my time at Belfast High School I built a range of skills and abilities 
                                    through of my experiences. I was a Computing prefect and in this role I went to junior school 
                                    computing classes and assisted these students in their practical work. I also 
                                    created the rota for this programme, for the assistant prefects, alongside the senior 
                                    prefect. This helped me to develop my leadership and organisational skills.
